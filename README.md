## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

This project is a calculator that does all of the logic on the server-side using GET/POST/DELETE routes. Technologies used include Node, AJAX, Express, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

This project taught me how to map data interactions between the client and the server.
